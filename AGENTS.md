# Repo Guidelines

This repository hosts the WiFi Handshake Capture React Native application.

## Development
- All application code lives in the `wifi-handshake-c/` directory.
- Keep implementations production-readyâ€”avoid placeholders and incomplete flows.
- Use TypeScript-friendly React Native patterns and keep components strongly typed.

## Formatting
- Format code with Prettier when touching files (`npx prettier --write <files>`).

## Testing
- From the `wifi-handshake-c/` directory run `npm run lint` and `npm test` before committing.
